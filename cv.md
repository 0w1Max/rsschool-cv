## About me
Hi guys! I apologize in advance for my English, it's not very good yet. My name is Maxim, I am 31 years old and I am from Moscow. When I got my first computer, I started learning HTML and CSS. It became my favorite hobby. I created simple websites in HTML with CSS styles, got to know Adobe Photoshop, and began to make layouts for websites. Then I discovered the wonderful world of programming and started learning different languages in my free time. At first I was interested in programming in PHP. After that I learned about JavaScript language and began to devote a lot of free time to it. Then I learned how to animate the pages of the website.  I was able to change blocks and styles without reloading the page. 
A lot of time passed, but my work was still not related to IT. Sometimes I helped acquaintances to fix a website or make a website from scratch, but my knowledge of web technologies was not enough. So I began to study IT technologies again.
I started watching a lot of training videos, reading documentation and theory, and taking paid and free IT courses. When I signed up for the elementary stage0 course from RSSchool, I had no idea that it was so cool and serious. Thanks to them, I am gaining more and more knowledge I need, experience. Now I feel more confident when I write code. A huge respect to the guys from RSSchool! You are doing a great job for beginners and not only!
Now my goal is to become a full-fledged web specialist. I really enjoy creating something new and interesting. This is my life!
