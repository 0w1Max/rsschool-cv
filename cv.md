## About me
I am 31 years old and I am from Moscow. When I got my first computer, I started learning HTML and CSS. It has become my favorite hobby. Then I discovered the amazing world of programming and started learning different languages in my spare time. A lot of time has passed, but my work was not related to IT. Now my goal is to become a full-fledged specialist in the field of web technologies. I really like to create something new and interesting.

  const splitQuery = query.split('&');
  const init: any = {};

  const result = splitQuery.reduce((acc, item) => {
    const [key, value] = item.split('=');
    acc[key] = value;

    return acc;
  }, init)

  return result;
