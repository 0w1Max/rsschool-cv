## About me
I am 31 years old and I am from Moscow. When I got my first computer, I started learning HTML and CSS. It has become my favorite hobby. Then I discovered the amazing world of programming and started learning different languages in my spare time. A lot of time has passed, but my work was not related to IT. Now my goal is to become a full-fledged specialist in the field of web technologies. I really like to create something new and interesting.

      }
    }
  
    arr.sort((first, second) => results[second] - results[first]);
